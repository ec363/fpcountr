Description: The major purpose of this package is to enable the conversion of fluorescence data obtained using microplate readers from arbitrary or relative units to biologically meaningful units via calibration. The first set of functions deals with how to calibrate microplate readers using fluorescent protein calibrants, including how to quantify fluorescent protein concentrations from absorbance spectra directly, and compare this with fluorescence intensity readings in arbitrary units to obtain 'conversion factors'. These can then be used to convert fluorescence readings from cellular (or cell-free) gene expression assays from 'arbitrary units' into molecule numbers, molar concentrations, or molecules per cell: a second set of functions for processing experimental data handles these. Finally, a range of helper functions enables: parsing of raw data into tidy data format, automating plate formats and well numbering, finding fluorescent protein properties, and calculating sample path lengths important for absorbance quantification. Methods in this package are described in Csibra and Stan (2022) <doi:10.1038/s41467-022-34232-6> "Absolute protein quantification using fluorescence measurements with FPCountR".
