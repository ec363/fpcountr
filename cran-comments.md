* This is a new release.

Installed size of package is 7.2Mb, primarily due to documentation (help and doc files). Vignettes and function docs contain extensive guidance for new users, including users new to R. This includes datasets and figures to illustrate what the package can do. The figures have been compressed. I believe this will support the reproducibility and usability of this package.
