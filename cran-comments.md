* This is a new release.

Installed size of package is 7.4Mb, primarily due to documentation (help and doc files). Vignettes and function docs contain extensive guidance for new users, including users new to R. This includes figures, as explanations are clearest with illustrations. The figures have been compressed. I believe this will support the reproducibility and usability of this package.
